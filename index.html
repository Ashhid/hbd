        Happy Birthday to my best friend in the whole internet!. You don't know
        the impact you have on me, but I'm so much glad you're here in my hard
        times, You can always count on me for anything okay?!. Thanks for
        everything Shenaaz... I'll be grateful till the deathbed. Miss those
        days with you in those streams. God if that day wasn't the right time
        we'd have never met. Will meet you soon in real life!. HBD Again!
